# CP1404 Practicals
# Practical Projects Repository
Welcome to my Practical Projects Repository! This report contains my work for the programming practicals in [CP1404](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).     I'm ZhuZhiwei , a student learning about programming patterns and clean code principles.


## About This Repository
This repository stores my practical exercises and projects as I progress through the subject.       The code demonstrates my growing understanding of programming concepts and best practices.


## Lessons Learned about Clean Code
**Meaningful variable names**: Using clear names like `total_price` instead of `tp` makes code self-explanatory, reducing confusion and easing maintenance.

 **Consistent formatting and documentation**: Uniform style and notes (e.g., this README) help others understand and collaborate on my code efficiently.

**Small, focused functions**: Keeping functions short and single-purpose, improves testability and clarity
