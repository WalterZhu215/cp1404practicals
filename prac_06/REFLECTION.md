I adjusted my process to better handle the demands of the job. Upon reflection, I began to break down the problem and deal with it more clearly

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

In terms of time, I will misestimate the time needed, and now I am in a passive learning state, I should change myself more. I love coding and learning

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Not very good. But in the future, when I have a problem, I will take the initiative to change

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should change my negative attitude, stop wasting time and improve my study efficiency.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

With clearer context guidance, I hope to get clearer task requirements and reasonable output cases to help me write code.
